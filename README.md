Original Neural Network (NN) Model:
The accuracy during training appears stagnant, hovering around 57-58%, and the loss reduces slightly but remains relatively high.
When evaluated on the test dataset, the model has a loss of NaN and an accuracy of approximately 0.465.

Optimized Neural Network (NN) Model:
The optimized model shows similar training behavior, with the accuracy improving slightly to ~0.4689 during evaluation on the test set.
However, the loss is still NaN, indicating a persistent issue in the model.
